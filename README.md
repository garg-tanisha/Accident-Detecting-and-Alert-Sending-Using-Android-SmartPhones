# Accident-Detecting-and-Alert-Sending-Using-Android-SmartPhones

# About Project
Accident Detection and Alert System using Android smartphones is a system to
detect accident and report it to emergency contacts using SMS services so that
response time may be decreased. The message will be sent to **emergency contacts**
chosen by the user. The **message** will contain **fine GPS location** of the user. It has
assumed that the mobile phone is somehow with the user, like in his/her pants. This
is to ensure the phone may not unnecessarily roll too much on application of brakes
until its non-serious issues.
To get the right values for the purpose, real-life crash tests were performed using
cycles, two-wheelers and a remote controlled car. This also checked for false
positives. The application used this values to build the logic.
The application was developed using Android framework. It supports all android
mobiles from Android JellyBean to Android P. Kotlin was used as programming
language keeping in mind Googleâ€™s attempt to popularise it.
On the whole, the application tend to be user friendly and help user in case of an
accident.
